              you're greeted with a custom welcome message including your

              Landing on the home page, you'll see a short and sweet table
              summarizing your month. This is punctuated by a custom message, a
              message that will vary if you spent more than you earned or if you
              saved a lot of money.

              This includes the obvious - total income, total expenses - but

              this month. Here is also where the envelope's budget comes into
              play: if you made an envelope to be "fixed," this page will give
              you warnings when you're close to an envelope's budget, or if

              thing you're greeted with is a handy little modal that will, at a
              glance, show you how much you've spent today. Click on the little

              divided into two categories: 'Fixed' and 'Variable.' Just as with
              the summary page, if your envelope is marked as 'fixed,' this page
              will warn you as you approach and/or exceed that budget. At a
              glance, you can see what an envelope's budget is, and how much
              you've spent out of it.

              Clicking it will open the modal to define the envelope's details.
              Name it anything you want, according to how you'll use it. You can
              click the buttons to switch between 'fixed' and 'variable.' Then
              you allocate a budget for it, and finally you can add any comments
              you want to it, although it's not necessary. Once you're all done,
              just click 'Add.'
